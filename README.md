# Module 10 Challenge

This project was designed for us to create a logo based on user input on color, shape, text and text color.
A SVG file will be created with the chosen inputs and can be viewed on a browser as well as tested with Jest.

I was able to accomplish this by:
    -Using inquirer to prompt user for input after creating multiple choices arrays
    -Creating functions to carry out the chosen input and writing it to an SVG file
    -Creating classes and constructors for the different shapes

This challenge was similiar to the last but added onto it with constructor functions and testing,
it took me a little bit to figure out the specifics as far what needed to be returned but apart from 
that it came pretty easily to me.
